User Story – The Bulletin Board:

Imagine that you need to share information with your entire organization,
but you don’t want to send an email to all your colleagues.

Instead, you use a digital bulletin board where all information is collected in one central place.
By logging in, users can read, create, and manage announcements in the form of digital post-it notes.
The notes are displayed in chronological order and can be sorted and filtered by category,
making it easy to quickly find relevant information.

The system is built in Java using JavaFX for the user interface, JPA for database management
and an SQL database for storing users and posts.

Features:
Create account:
As a user, I want to be able to create my own account or create an account for a team member.

Log in:
As a user, I want to log in to the system in order to access and manage posts.

View posts:
As a user, I want to see all posts on the bulletin board in descending date order so
that I can quickly get an overview of the latest information.

Show posts in fullscreen:
As a user, I want to be able to click on a specific post-it to show it in fullscreen to see all details.

Create a new post:
As a logged-in user, I want to create a new post with a title, message, and categories
so that I can share information with other users.

Update existing post:
As the creator of a post, I want to update my post so that I can correct or change information when needed.

Delete post:
As the creator of a post, I want to delete my post in order to keep the bulletin board relevant and up to date.

Profile-handling:
As a logged in user, I want to be able to edit my account information such as bio, name, Username and Password.

Profile – my notes:
As a logged in user, I want to be able to show, edit and delete my own posted notes.

Each post is associated with a user in the database (User, Post, and User_Post)
and is stored together with a timestamp and category, enabling sorting and filtering functionality.
